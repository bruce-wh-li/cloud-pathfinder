# Evaluation
We recommend that all team members review our pre-reading material: [CloudPathfinderPre-ReadingMaterial.pdf](https://github.com/bcgov/cloud-pathfinder/raw/master/devhub-content/assets/CloudPathfinderPre-ReadingMaterial.pdf)

Ask your Product Owner to begin working on our onboarding forms:

- [Product Team Profile](https://airtable.com/shrDjz71N7eOAeLcw)
- [Cloud Service Provider selection rationale](https://airtable.com/shrnB89KfH2MoR7jx)
- [MOU for expense authority approval of estimated cloud spend](https://airtable.com/shrnqVHUyqxz5luMS)

Let us know if you need help with these forms: [Cloud.Pathfinder@gov.bc.ca](mailto:Cloud.Pathfinder@gov.bc.ca)
